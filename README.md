Investigating decision boundaries across nine distinct datasets using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm involves analyzing how these boundaries shift in response to changes in the K value. In simpler terms, we're examining how the KNN algorithm draws lines or boundaries to separate different classes in each dataset. By adjusting the K value, which determines the number of neighboring points considered in classification, we observe how these boundaries adapt and vary across the datasets.
